        <p><h3>Now that you know the rules and everyone has a role, this is how a game will be played:</h3></p>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Make sure to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Players get into a starting position and the ref throws the balls on the field.</li>
                    <li>The keeper defends, the chaser scores and the beater disrupts. </li>
                    <li>If you've been disrupted get off your broom and tag a hoop.</li>
                    <li>Pick a keeper so it's harder for enemies to score.</li>
                    <li>Make sure theres someone who count the score and time.</li>
                    <li>After a couple of minutes the snitch will be released.</li>
                    <li>Stop the game once the snitch has been caught.</li>
                    <li>Did the game end up at a tie after the snitch has been caught? The next team to score, wins.</li>
                </ol>
